# Changes
## v1.01 (2025-02-02)

### Mobile Dashboard Update
v1.0 included a bar chart displaying Safe to Spend, 2 "categories to watch", and a cash value, in addition to a donut chart breaking down spending categories. v1.01 now has "scorecard" charts in place of the bar chart. This should improve accessibility for mobile use. 

> Google Sheets displays charts differently on their web app vs on the mobile app; the mobile dashboard is designed and tested on a Samsung S22 and generally looks like trash on the desktop but looks better on the phone. The mobile app will *always* show some sort of chart background, as well, so that's just something to deal with until Google sees the light.
