## Overview
This is a spending tracker that works like the [Simple](https://www.reviewed.com/money/features/simple-bank-review) banking app (closed in 2021 üò≠), keeping things easy and helping you stay organized. It's designed specifically for folks with *ADHD* and *dyscalculia*, so you won‚Äôt have to worry about complicated math or shelling out cash for fancy budgeting apps.

There are **8 sheets** in total, but you‚Äôll mostly use it to keep an eye on your spending (**Activity**) and check your balances (**Mobile, Desktop**). To kick things off, you‚Äôll set up your expenses, goals, spending categories, and income. Then you just log your daily spending and the **Safe to Spend** balance will automatically update to show you how much you can spend without going overboard.

## In Detail

This is a **dupe** of the now-closed fintech bank and budget app **[Simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ksj1ho/simple_is_being_shut_down/)**. It combines elements of  

- **[Envelope budgeting](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/envelope-system#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCash%20stuffing%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20also%20known%20as%20the,to%20take%20an%20action%20on%20their%20website.)** (allocating money to specific categories)   

- **[The Conscious Spending Plan](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/)** (Ramit Sethi's approach)

## üõ† Setup (One-Time Tasks)  
>[!Tip] üå∂Ô∏è Tip 
>Try setting a timer (10-15 mins per section) to break setup into manageable chunks.  

### ‚úÖ Step 1: [Expenses & Goals](https://github.com/jeremyraby/simpleBudgetApp/blob/main/expenses_goals.jpg) *(~10 min)*
1. Enter your planned expenses & savings goals.  
2. Assign each to a category (*Need*, *Want*, or *Savings*).  
3. Enter any emergency savings you already have.  
4. üîπ **Hide this sheet** when finished.  
#### üí∞ Goal Calculator  

The **Goal Calculator** in the **Expenses & Goals** sheet helps you determine how much to save per month to reach a financial goal by a specific deadline.  

##### üîπ How It Works 
1. **Enter your goal amount** ‚Äì How much you need to save.  
2. **Enter today‚Äôs date** ‚Äì The starting point for calculations.  
3. **Enter your current balance** ‚Äì How much you‚Äôve already saved.  
4. **Enter your target date** ‚Äì When you need the money.  
5. The system calculates how much you should save per month.  

##### üìä Example  
| Input  | Example Value |
|--------|--------------|
| Goal Amount | `$1,200` |
| Today's Date | `02/01/2025` |
| Current Balance | `$200` |
| Date Needed | `06/30/2025` |
| **Save per Month** | `$250` |

>[!Tip] üå∂Ô∏è Tip  
>- **Break it into smaller chunks** ‚Äì If the monthly savings feels too high (your Safe to Spend is unsustainably low), adjust your goal date or split the goal into phases.  
>- **Automation** ‚Äì Set up automated transfers between your checking & savings accounts each payday.  
>- **Track progress** ‚Äì Check your savings balance each payday to stay on track.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: [Categories](https://github.com/jeremyraby/simpleBudgetApp/blob/main/categories.jpg) *(~5 min)*
1. Define spending categories (e.g., Groceries, Rent, Fun Money).  
2. Pick **1-2 categories to watch** (for overspending awareness). 
	1. These should be planned in the **Expenses & Goals** sheet.
3. List income sources (e.g., Paycheck, Side Hustle, Cash Refunds).  
4. üîπ **Hide this sheet** when finished.  

### ‚úÖ Step 3: [Income](https://github.com/jeremyraby/simpleBudgetApp/blob/main/income.jpg) *(Only When Paid)*
1. Enter income when received (**date, source, amount, notes**).  
	1. Cash gifts, ATM withdrawals, and refunds all count
2. Ignore the `#VALUE` error in `E1`‚Äîit disappears when income is logged.  
3. üîπ **Hide this sheet** after entering income.

## ‚ùì FAQ 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why are some cells/ranges yellow?  
üü° **yellow cells contain formulas**‚Äîavoid editing unless troubleshooting.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What if I forget to log a purchase?  
‚úÖ Use the **end-of-week check-in** method: once a week, review your bank statement or transaction history and fill in any missing expenses.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if I don‚Äôt press the Archive button?  
üìå The system won‚Äôt reset, and **old expenses will carry over** into the next cycle. Set a **calendar reminder** to press the button on payday.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why is my Safe to Spend different from my bank balance?  
üìå Safe to Spend reflects what‚Äôs **left after planned expenses**. It‚Äôs not your raw bank balance.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ How do I unhide sheets if I need to edit something?  
üîπ **Right-click any tab > View All Sheets > Click the one you need.**  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Can I protect formulas from accidental edits?  
‚úÖ Yes! Go to **Data > Protect Sheets & Ranges** and select the yellow-highlighted cells and sheets. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBAr_Tx2SKQ?si=DZhnaKRwy6B60GXz) for more info.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What's a "Conscious Spending Plan?" How's it different than a budget?
üìå Ramit Sethi calls budgets "Conscious Spending Plans" and I tend to like the idea more than "budgets." I've simplified this idea a bit, though, into just "Needs," Wants," and "Savings." Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/unbA3nASp6g?si=ILGMKzuJYsJhrUfL) for more info.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What if I don't know which "categories to watch?"
‚úÖ Leave those options blank for a couple of pay cycles and use the **Desktop** to help identify categories where you could cut back.

## üß† Tips for ADHD & Dyscalculia Users
- **Make it a habit**: Use a **daily notification** (Google Calendar, phone alarm) to log expenses.
	- **Anchor it to other habits**: Do you use a receipt app like Fetch or Upside to get cash back rewards? Log your expenses whenever you scan the receipts!
- **Use the Mobile tab**: It‚Äôs designed for fast, on-the-go reference.  
- **Customize categories**: Rename categories so they make sense to you!
