Overview
This is a spending tracker that works like the Simple banking app (closed in 2021 üò≠), keeping things easy and helping you stay organized. It's designed specifically for folks with ADHD and dyscalculia, so you won‚Äôt have to worry about complicated math or shelling out cash for fancy budgeting apps.

There are 8 sheets in total, but you‚Äôll mostly use it to keep an eye on your spending (Activity) and check your balances (Mobile, Desktop). To kick things off, you‚Äôll set up your expenses, goals, spending categories, and income. Then you just log your daily spending and the Safe to Spend balance will automatically update to show you how much you can spend without going overboard.

In Detail
This is a dupe of the now-closed fintech bank and budget app Simple. It combines elements of

Envelope budgeting (allocating money to specific categories)

The Conscious Spending Plan (Ramit Sethi's approach)

üìå How It Works
The workbook has 8 sheets but only a few are used daily.

üîµ Everyday Use (Blue Tabs)
Mobile ‚Äì A simplified dashboard for quick reference.
Activity ‚Äì Where you log daily expenses.
Desktop ‚Äì A larger dashboard with more visualizations.
üü¢ Setup & Updates (Green Tabs)
Expenses & Goals ‚Äì Define planned expenses and savings goals.
Categories ‚Äì Set up spending and income categories.
Income ‚Äì Log your income when received.
üü° Behind-the-Scenes (Yellow Tabs)
Archive ‚Äì Stores past transactions for long-term tracking.
Tables ‚Äì Handles calculations and reference data.
üîπ Tip: Hide the green and yellow tabs after setup to keep your view clean.

üõ† Setup (One-Time Tasks)
üå∂Ô∏è Tip
Try setting a timer (10-15 mins per section) to break setup into manageable chunks.

‚úÖ Step 1: Expenses & Goals (~10 min)
Enter your planned expenses & savings goals.
Assign each to a category (Need, Want, or Savings).
Enter any emergency savings you already have.
üîπ Hide this sheet when finished.
üí∞ Goal Calculator
The Goal Calculator in the Expenses & Goals sheet helps you determine how much to save per month to reach a financial goal by a specific deadline.

üîπ How It Works
Enter your goal amount ‚Äì How much you need to save.
Enter today‚Äôs date ‚Äì The starting point for calculations.
Enter your current balance ‚Äì How much you‚Äôve already saved.
Enter your target date ‚Äì When you need the money.
The system calculates how much you should save per month.
üìä Example
Input	Example Value
Goal Amount	$1,200
Today's Date	02/01/2025
Current Balance	$200
Date Needed	06/30/2025
Save per Month	$250
üå∂Ô∏è Tip
Break it into smaller chunks ‚Äì If the monthly savings feels too high (your Safe to Spend is unsustainably low), adjust your goal date or split the goal into phases.
Automation ‚Äì Set up automated transfers between your checking & savings accounts each payday.
Track progress ‚Äì Check your savings balance each payday to stay on track.
‚úÖ Step 2: Categories (~5 min)
Define spending categories (e.g., Groceries, Rent, Fun Money).
Pick 1-2 categories to watch (for overspending awareness).
These should be planned in the Expenses & Goals sheet.
List income sources (e.g., Paycheck, Side Hustle, Cash Refunds).
üîπ Hide this sheet when finished.
‚úÖ Step 3: Income (Only When Paid)
Enter income when received (date, source, amount, notes).
Cash gifts, ATM withdrawals, and refunds all count
Ignore the #VALUE error in E1‚Äîit disappears when income is logged.
üîπ Hide this sheet after entering income.
üí∞ Daily & Pay Cycle Workflow
üîπ Daily: Log Purchases in Activity (~30 sec)
Enter purchases (date, amount, store, category, notes).
Check your Safe to Spend balance at the top of Activity or Mobile.
üîπ End of Pay Cycle: Archive Data (~5 sec)
Click the üîµ Archive Data button (top of Activity sheet).
This clears your spending/income logs & saves them in Archive.
‚ùì FAQ
1Ô∏è‚É£ Why are some cells/ranges yellow?
üü° yellow cells contain formulas‚Äîavoid editing unless troubleshooting.

2Ô∏è‚É£ What if I forget to log a purchase?
‚úÖ Use the end-of-week check-in method: once a week, review your bank statement or transaction history and fill in any missing expenses.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if I don‚Äôt press the Archive button?
üìå The system won‚Äôt reset, and old expenses will carry over into the next cycle. Set a calendar reminder to press the button on payday.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Why is my Safe to Spend different from my bank balance?
üìå Safe to Spend reflects what‚Äôs left after planned expenses. It‚Äôs not your raw bank balance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ How do I unhide sheets if I need to edit something?
üîπ Right-click any tab > View All Sheets > Click the one you need.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Can I protect formulas from accidental edits?
‚úÖ Yes! Go to Data > Protect Sheets & Ranges and select the yellow-highlighted cells and sheets. See video below for more info:


7Ô∏è‚É£ What's a "Conscious Spending Plan?" How's it different than a budget?
üìå Ramit Sethi calls budgets "Conscious Spending Plans" and I tend to like the idea more than "budgets." I've simplified this idea a bit, though, into just "Needs," Wants," and "Savings." Learn more in the video below:


8Ô∏è‚É£ What if I don't know which "categories to watch?"
‚úÖ Leave those options blank for a couple of pay cycles and use the Desktop to help identify categories where you could cut back.

üß† Tips for ADHD & Dyscalculia Users
Make it a habit: Use a daily notification (Google Calendar, phone alarm) to log expenses.
Anchor it to other habits: Do you use a receipt app like Fetch or Upside to get cash back rewards? Log your expenses whenever you scan the receipts!
Use the Mobile tab: It‚Äôs designed for fast, on-the-go reference.
Customize categories: Rename categories so they make sense to you!
