# Color Palette
Based on the color #2596be found in [Simple's logo](https://simple-finance-technology-corp-simple.en.aptoide.com/app). `Roboto` is also used for the font. I used an online color picker to get the logo color then had ChatGPT give me a color palatte  based around it so I could customize a theme in Google Sheets.
